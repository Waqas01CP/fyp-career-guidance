## Plan Summary

### Splash Screen
- `ConsumerStatefulWidget` with `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`
- `AnimationController` 1800ms, `Curves.easeInOut`, width 0→120px
- `_controller.forward()` and `_resolveRoute()` called simultaneously in `initState()` — animation runs concurrently with network call
- Routing: `AuthService.getToken()` → no token → '/onboarding'; token exists → `profileProvider.loadProfile()` → route by `onboardingStage`; 401 → '/onboarding'; network error → '/onboarding' (fail-safe)
- `kDebugMode` guard on DEBUG BUILD annotation
- `mounted` check before `Navigator.pushReplacementNamed()`

### Carousel Screen
- `StatefulWidget`, `PageController` + `int _currentPage` local state
- 3 slides, `PageView.builder`, `BouncingScrollPhysics`
- `AnimatedContainer` for dot indicators (active 28×3, inactive 6×3)
- Skip → '/login'; Next on slides 1–2 → next page; Get Started on slide 3 → '/login'
- Bento grid: simple `Container` + `Row`/`Column` cells — no SVG, no CustomPainter
- `_BentoCell` extracted as private `StatelessWidget` to enable const reuse

## Deviations from DESIGN_HANDOFF.md

| Deviation | Reason | Justified by |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `Icons.auto_stories` used instead of `material_symbols_icons` package | Prompt explicitly says "use Icons.auto_stories — do NOT import material_symbols_icons" | Explicit task instruction (highest priority) |
| Bento card right column: concentric circles instead of SVG chart | Prompt says "No SVG, no CustomPainter — simple colored rounded containers". DESIGN_HANDOFF.md Screen 02 section 13 suggests `flutter_svg` or `CustomPainter` | Explicit task constraint (no new packages) |
| Network error → '/onboarding' (not ErrorScreen) | Prompt says "Network error → '/onboarding' (fail safe)". DESIGN_HANDOFF.md Screen 01 section 10 says "If network error → ErrorScreen" | Explicit task instruction takes precedence |
| Slide 2 + 3 text sourced from design brief | `code_onboarding_carousel.html` only renders slide 1; slides 2–3 text not in HTML | Only available text source |
| Avatar stack omitted from footer | No local image assets; placeholder circles would add noise. Design shows real photos only | Low-end device first; assets to be added before demo |

## flutter run result

**Not executed.** The HARD RULES state "Do NOT modify main.dart". Without route updates, `SplashScreen` and `CarouselScreen` are not accessible via named routes. Both screens resolve correctly in `flutter analyze` and would function as designed once wired.

### Action required before testing
Two lines in `main.dart` need updating (not done in this session per HARD RULES):

```dart
// Line to update in routes table:
'/onboarding': (context) => const CarouselScreen(),
// Import to add:
import 'screens/onboarding/carousel_screen.dart';
```

The `'/'` → `AppRouter` route already handles splash-equivalent logic. `SplashScreen` can replace `AppRouter` as the initial route in a dedicated wiring session:
```dart
'/': (context) => const SplashScreen(),
// Import to add:
import 'screens/splash_screen.dart';
```

Alternatively, test the carousel immediately: temporarily replace the '/onboarding' placeholder in main.dart with `CarouselScreen()`.

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **main.dart not wired** — screens built, analyze-clean, but not yet accessible via routes. Requires separate wiring step (not in scope for this session).
2. **Avatar stack omitted** — HTML footer shows 3 circular avatar photos. Omitted because no local assets exist and network images violate "backend URL never localhost" spirit + offline-first requirement. Add as local assets before demo.
3. **Slide 2–3 bento content** — Slides 2 and 3 bento visual is a simplified concentric-circle pattern (same structure as slide 1, different icons/labels). HTML only shows slide 1 bento so exact visual targets for 2–3 are unknown.

---

## Rule Deviation — Two Screens in One Session

Justified per FRONTEND_SPRINT_BUILD_PROCESS.md "Splash + Carousel can be one session (no API calls)". Both screens are pre-auth with no SSE or complex state. Combined session reduces overhead with no quality risk.

## Fix — Carousel web viewport overflow — 2026-04-24

### Root cause
`AspectRatio(aspectRatio: 1.0)` inside `_buildSlide()` uses the full available width as its constraint. On Chrome at 1472px wide, the unconstrained `PageView` offers ~1472px width, making the card 1472×1472px — overflowing the column by ~1087px. On mobile (390dp) this does not trigger because the card fits within screen height.

### Fix 1 — ConstrainedBox cap at 280×280
Wrapped `AspectRatio` in `ConstrainedBox(constraints: BoxConstraints(maxHeight: 280, maxWidth: 280))`. The card now never exceeds 280px regardless of viewport width.

### Fix 2 — SingleChildScrollView safety net
Wrapped the entire `_buildSlide()` return in `SingleChildScrollView`. If any future content (longer body text, accessibility font sizes) causes the slide column to exceed the available `PageView` height, it scrolls instead of overflowing.

### File changed
`frontend/lib/screens/onboarding/carousel_screen.dart` — `_buildSlide()` method only.

## Frontend Chat Fix — routing + colour — 2026-04-25

### Fix 1 — 'complete' stage added to _routeForStage() (splash_screen.dart)

**File:** `frontend/lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`
**Change:** Added `case 'complete': return '/chat';` before `default` in `_routeForStage()`.
**Reason:** `onboarding_stage = 'complete'` is set after the first chat session. Without this case, every returning user after their first use is routed back to RIASEC quiz instead of chat — critical routing bug.

### Fix 2 — Bento label colour and font size (carousel_screen.dart)

**File:** `frontend/lib/screens/onboarding/carousel_screen.dart`
**Change:** In `_buildAptitudeVisual()` label `TextStyle`:
- `color: Color(0xFF6E7977)` → `color: Color(0xFF515F74)`
- `fontSize: 7` → `fontSize: 10`
**Reason:** `0xFF6E7977` is the outline/border token — never used for text per the accessibility pass. `fontSize: 7` is below the 9px accessibility minimum.
